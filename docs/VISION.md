## 🎯 Development Principle

> **"This is all about projections into future and current months with the transactions I keep on recording"**

**Every feature, every enhancement, and every decision must align with this core purpose:**

1. ✅ **Supports financial projections** (current and future)
2. ✅ **Enables informed decision-making** (savings, expenditures, purchases)
3. ✅ **Uses transaction history** as the foundation
4. ✅ **Provides visibility** into months ahead (minimum 5 years)

## 📋 Feature Prioritization

When planning new features or enhancements, prioritize:

1. **High Priority**: Features that directly support financial projections and forecasting
2. **Medium Priority**: Features that improve transaction recording and tracking
3. **Lower Priority**: Features that don't contribute to the core projection functionality

## 🚀 Future Development Guidelines

All future development should:

- ✅ Enhance the projection accuracy and visibility
- ✅ Improve transaction recording and categorization
- ✅ Provide better insights for decision-making
- ✅ Support longer-term financial planning
- ✅ Enable smarter purchase and savings decisions
